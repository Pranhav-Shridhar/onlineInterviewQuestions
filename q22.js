// What are the primitive data types in JS?

// A primitive is a basic data type thatâ€™s not built out of other data types. It can only represent one single value. All primitives are built-in data types by necessity, (the compiler has to know about them,) but not all built-in data types are primitives.

// In JavaScript there are 5 primitive data types are available they are undefined, null, boolean, string and number are available.Everything else in Javascript is an object.
